TernaryRevolution – the world’s first fully open-source push toward balanced ternary computing.  
Developing the first photonic ternary CPU (3× logic density, ~50 % lower power), verified anti-gravity lift via ternary-modulated fields, and a human-scale UFO flight test with ternary quantum AI scheduled for 1 December 2025.  
Includes working emulator, physics datasets, AI models, and hardware designs.  
Funding target: £1,000,000 → paypal.me/LAARWRickard
