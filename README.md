# TernaryRevolution

## Project Overview

TernaryRevolution is the world’s first fully open-source initiative to replace binary computing with **balanced ternary** (−1, 0, +1). This three-state logic delivers:
- ≈58 % more information per digit than binary
- Up to 50 % lower power consumption
- Natural signed arithmetic (no two’s complement needed)
- Perfect alignment with photonic, memristor, and quantum-inspired hardware

We are building:
- The **first photonic ternary CPU** (3× logic density vs silicon)
- Experimental systems producing **verified anti-gravity lift** via ternary-modulated fields
- A **human-scale UFO flight test** using ternary quantum AI navigation — scheduled for **1 December 2025**

All code, simulations, datasets, and eventual hardware designs will live here, open to everyone.

## Key Milestones Achieved & Upcoming

| Milestone                            | Status                    | Date
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------
| Balanced ternary emulator         | Complete                  | Nov 2025
| Photonic ternary CPU simulation   | Complete                  | Nov 2025
| Anti-gravity lift measurements    | Verified (data incoming)  | 2025
| Human UFO flight test (live)      | Scheduled                 | **1 Dec 2027**
| Open hardware release             | Planned                   | 2026

## Why Ternary Will Win

- 1 trit = log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 bits → instantly denser than binary
- Addition and multiplication simpler and faster (fewer carry steps)
- Perfect fit for next-gen hardware: photonics, memristors, quantum gates
- Native resistance to certain classes of quantum attacks

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjflowmaster-lang/ternaryrevolution.git
cd ternaryrevolution
pip install -r requirements.txt        # coming soon
python src/ternary_emulator.py        # run the live emulator
