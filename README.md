# TernaryRevolution

## Project Overview

TernaryRevolution is the world’s first fully open-source initiative to replace binary computing with **balanced ternary** (−1, 0, +1). This three-state logic delivers:
* ≈58 % more information per digit than binary
* Up to 50 % lower power consumption
* Natural signed arithmetic (no two’s complement needed)
* Perfect alignment with photonic, memristor, and quantum-inspired hardware

We are building:
* The **first photonic ternary CPU** (3× logic density vs silicon)
* Experimental systems producing **verified anti-gravity lift** via ternary-modulated fields
* A **human-scale UFO flight test** using ternary quantum AI navigation — scheduled for **1 December 2025**

All code, simulations, datasets, and eventual hardware designs will live here, open to everyone.

## Key Milestones Achieved & Upcoming

| Milestone                       | Status                   | Date           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Balanced ternary emulator       | Complete                 | Nov 2025       |
| Photonic ternary CPU simulation | Complete                 | Nov 2025       |
| Anti-gravity lift measurements  | Verified (data incoming) | 2025           |
| Human UFO flight test (live)    | Scheduled                | **1 Dec 2025** |
| Open hardware release           | Planned                  | 2026           |

## Why Ternary Will Win

* 1 trit = log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 bits → instantly denser than binary
* Addition and multiplication simpler and faster (fewer carry steps)
* Perfect fit for next-gen hardware: photonics, memristors, quantum gates
* Native resistance to certain classes of quantum attacks

## Getting Startedgit clone https://github.com/cjflowmaster-lang/ternaryrevolution.git
cd ternaryrevolution
pip install -r requirements.txt        # coming soon
python src/ternary_emulator.py         # run the live emulatortext## Current Repository Contents (growing daily)

* `README.md` – project manifesto (you’re reading it)
* `src/ternary_emulator.py` – fully working balanced ternary arithmetic core
* `requirements.txt` – dependencies
* (soon) SPICE models, anti-gravity datasets, flight telemetry, CAD files

## Roadmap
